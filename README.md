# Java_project
This is a program to practice OOP, data structures ad recursion.
Data structures: RB tree, CLL, LLL, Arrays.

A Rad-Black tree is created reading in a file. Each node of the tree is a topic name (category) 
that holds a LLL of information divided in website, Linux tools and differences between C++ syntax and Java syntax.
A CLL is created, reading in from a file, using the syntax differences
between C++ and Java syntax. This program uses recursive and iterative methods.
A UML is provided to see the implementation of the classes and how they interact to each other.

With the project are also provided txt files for testing.
